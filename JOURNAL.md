1. **Finalized THE Plan**

   * Removed and added from the original plan to reduce cost and enhance efficiency.
   * decided to 3D print the full chassis instead of using off-the-shelf kits, as it seemed a better option.
   * After that, finalized dimensions: Height 25–27 inches, Width 13–15 inches. The gap is for errors in print or size of modules.
   * Started 3d printing part but wasn't  able to make a path.

2. **Component Discussion**

   * Decided to put 2 cameras, for multiple reasons, one will be used for gesture tracking and the other one will be used for navigation.
   * bluetooth beacons included for item tracking use cases, few things that will make it look cool as well.

1. **Step File and PCB**
   * Skipped PCB; opted for manual wiring, because that's what i can do perfectly, i believe.
