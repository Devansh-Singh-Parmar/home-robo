# HOME ROBO

### Description
This project is a 25inch personal assistant robot designed for home use as of now. Goal is to make things easier, have communication with people who are in the different corner of the house, easily. And i'm trying implement a pulley thing as well, so well. Apart from this this robot will be able to have two communications through wifi, even if someone is not in the home they can keep their presence their in the form of this robot, and once you're back it'll welcome you like any loyal dog will do. Through Lidar it'll record the map of the home and can go anywhere(i will classify locations), so let's say to the robo "go to my room", and you'll monitor through your phone and once it reached you can speak through your phone and it'll say there. Pretty Easy.

### Why I Made This
To be honest, it seems cool to me and will help me as I don't want to leave my desk when i'm focused. Apart from that, if this works out better than expected, i might will try popularising it and making a demand so i can sell this maybe.
